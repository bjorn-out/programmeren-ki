= Problem Set 2: Crypto

== tl;dr
 
[start=0]
. Watch https://video.cs50.net/2016/fall/lectures/2[Week 2's lecture].
. Infer a user's initials from their name with `initials.c`.
. Choose two adventures:
+
--
* Implement Caesar's cipher.
* Implement Vigen√®re's cipher.
* Crack passwords.
--
+
. Submit your code.

== Reminders

Per https://video.cs50.net/2016/fall/lectures/2[Week 2's lecture]:

* Use `help50` as needed.
* Use `eprintf` as needed.
* Use `debug50` as needed.

== Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and execute

[source]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can't find it!), make sure that *Console* is checked under the *View* menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE's bottom half, then select *New Terminal*.

Next, execute

[source]
----
mkdir ~/workspace/pset2/
----

at your prompt in order to make a directory called `pset2` in your `workspace` directory. Take care not to overlook the space between `mkdir` and `~/workspace/pset2` or any other character for that matter!  Keep in mind that `~` denotes your home directory, `~/workspace` denotes a directory called `workspace` therein, and `~/workspace/pset2` denotes a directory called `pset2` within `~/workspace`.

Now execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/
----

to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

[source]
----
~/workspace/pset2/ $
----

If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong. You can actually execute

[source,bash]
----
history
----

at the prompt to see your last several commands in chronological order if you'd like to do some sleuthing. You can also scroll through the same one line at a time by hitting your keyboard's up and down arrows; hit Enter to re-execute any command that you'd like. 

== What to Do

. Implement either of:
+
--
* link:/problems/initials-less[Initials], less comfortable
* link:/problems/initials-more[Initials], more comfortable
--
+
. Implement any two (2) of:
+
--
* link:/problems/caesar[Caesar], less comfortable
* link:/problems/vigenere[Vigenere], less comfortable
* link:/problems/crack[Crack], more comfortable
