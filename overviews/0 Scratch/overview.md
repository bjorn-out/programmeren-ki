# Module 0: Scratch

In this module, you'll write your first program! You'll do this in Scratch, a fun language that makes a lot of complex things easy to do, like animating pictures on the screen.


## Grading

Your Scratch program will be automatically checked for adherence to the requirements (i.e., using two sprites, three scripts, etc.).


## What to Do

1. Watch the lecture on [Computational thinking](/lectures/computational-thinking)

2. Write and submit your first program: [Scratch](/problems/scratch)
{: start="0"}
