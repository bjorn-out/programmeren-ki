# Module 1: C

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You'll start with the small ones!


## Getting Started

Your first program will be a classic. The goal of this exercise is to try out compiling your program, maybe fixing a typo and getting used to the editor. No need to submit!

- Watch the lecture on [C](/lectures/c)

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:.external}

- Write your first program: [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/hello/){:.external}

Next up, you'll create an instance of the CS50 IDE, which will be your "code editor" for the coming weeks. The goal is to write a very small program from scratch and learning to test your program using `check50`. (Note that the IDE currently only works in Chrome and Firefox!)

- Login to the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/){:.external} using your GitHub account

- Learn about using the [Command Line](/shorts/command-line) in the IDE

- Create a "`module1`" directory in the IDE as by `mkdir ~/module1` and `cd` into it

- Implement [Water](/problems/water)


## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Comments](/quality/comments)
- [Naming](/quality/naming)
- [Indenting code](/quality/indentation)
- [Whitespace](/quality/whitespace)

Don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much.


## What to Do

#### 1. Preparation

Make sure you're prepared by following the instructions in "Getting Started", above!

#### 2. Greedy

- Watch the lecture on [Tools](/lectures/tools)

- Implement [Greedy](/problems/greedy)

#### 3. Mario

- Implement [Mario](/problems/mario-less)

#### 4. Credit

- Implement [Credit](/problems/credit)

#### 5. Exercises

Study and take the test:

- [Variables](/exercises/variables)

#### 6. Submit

You can submit your solutions on the problem pages linked above. Before submitting, keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (like plagiarism).
