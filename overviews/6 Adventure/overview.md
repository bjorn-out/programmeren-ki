# Module 9: Adventure

In this module, you'll again implement a game. This time, the running game will contain a lot of objects that together form the map of an adventure.


## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Nesting](/quality/nesting)
- [Dead code](/quality/dead-code)
- [Duplicated effort](/quality/duplicated-effort)
- [Scope](/quality/scope)

And we'll also take these into account from previous weeks: [comments](/quality/comments), [naming](/quality/naming), [indentation](/quality/indentation), [whitespace](/quality/whitespace), [duplication](/quality/duplication) and [magic numbers](/quality/magic-numbers).


## What to Do

Implement either of:

- [Adventure](/problems/adventure-less)

- [Adventure, Hacker edition](/problems/adventure-more)

You can submit your solutions on the problem pages linked above. Before submitting, keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (like plagiarism).
