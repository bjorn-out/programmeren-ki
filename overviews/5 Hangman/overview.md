## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Magic numbers](/quality/magic-numbers)
- [Loops](/quality/loops)
- [Duplication](/quality/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from last week: [comments](/quality/comments), [naming](/quality/naming), [indentation](/quality/indentation), [whitespace](/quality/whitespace).
